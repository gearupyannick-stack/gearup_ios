# GearUp ðŸš—ðŸ“±

GearUp is a Flutter mobile app designed to help users learn about cars â€” brands, models, years, origins, and technical specs â€” in a gamified and engaging way. Think of it as **Duolingo for cars**: quizzes, challenges, and achievements make learning fun while ads and premium features support the project.
